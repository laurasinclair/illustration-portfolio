        This project was part of a hackathon. <br />
        Yoda is a scooter rental app. The companyâ€™s mission is to make cities more livable by reducing car usage, traffic, and carbon emissions. <br />
        For this, I designed custom avatars for users to choose from, as well as simple screens for the app.
