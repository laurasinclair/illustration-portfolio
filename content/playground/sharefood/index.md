        Sharefood is an app for redistribution of unsold food, initiated during a hackathon. <br />
        The team had come up with basic wireframes. I was in charge of helping them shape and design a clean version of the UI, giving the brand a consistent and sleek look, with a friendly touch provided by custom illustrations.
