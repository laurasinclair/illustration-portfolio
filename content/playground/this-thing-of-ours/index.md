        <strong>In 2021, studio This Thing of Ours (thisthing.studio) launched a collaborative animation for International Women’s Day, built around the theme #ChooseToChallenge.</strong><br />
        The unifying image—a woman raising her hand—was interpreted by 90 illustrators from around the world, each contributing a single frame in their own style to form a seamless animated loop. <br />
        The open call, shared on Instagram, received over 600 submissions. I was honoured to be one of the 90 artists selected to take part in this powerful celebration of women and global creativity. ❤️
