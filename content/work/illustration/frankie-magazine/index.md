    A self-initiated project based on an article published in Frankie Magazine, about maintaining a healthy relationship with the Internet.
    I wanted to explore the idea that being online can't be portrayed as all good or all bad, it just is a part of our lives. <br />
    How do we set boundaries? How do we let go? <br />
    Are we ever fully disconnected? <br />
