	description: "A self-initiated project based on an article published in Frankie Magazine, about maintaining a healthy relationship with the Internet. \n
	I wanted to explore the idea that being online can't be portrayed as all good or all bad, it just is a part of our lives. \n
	How do we set boundaries? How do we let go? \n
	Are we ever fully disconnected?
