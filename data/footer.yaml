      <p>Yes, I also make websites!</p>
      <p>
        I designed this website using <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a> for the overall look and feel, and Photoshop to edit pictures.<br />
        Built with html/css using <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a> to generate static pages, <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a> to compile css, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> for grid, spacing, and tons of css helpers. Bits of javascript found on <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">Codepen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/explore" target="_blank">Github</a >, or in the awesome <a href="https://www.superhi.com/courses/advanced-css-and-javascript" target="_blank">SuperHi Javascript course</a>. <br />All hosted on Github.
